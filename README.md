# What it does: Our program allows the user to input their name and age (in years), and we store these in two different variables called name and age. Then, we make a new variable called months, which calculates the user's age in month. Then, we print out both the user's name and their age in months.

# How to use it: Run the program, and put in the inputs that the program asks for. 

# How to contribute: Fork the repository to change the code, and then submit a pull request to us. 

# Our Code of Conduct: We chose to use this code of conduct because it was recommended from GitHub. We think this will encourage people who want to make the code better to help, and will also encourage good behavior between contributors.
