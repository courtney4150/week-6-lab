# What it does: Our program allows the user to input their name and age (in years), and we store these in two different variables called name and age. Then, we make a new variable called months, which calculates the user's age in month. Then, we print out both the user's name and their age in months.

# How to use it: Run the program, and put in the inputs that the program asks for. 

# How to contribute: Fork the repository to change the code, and then submit a pull request to us. 

# We chose to use this License because it allows for anyone to copy and distribute our code without any issues regarding copyrighting.
